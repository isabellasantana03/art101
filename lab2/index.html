					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was editing structural elements of the page through the HTML code while styling it with the CSS code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems we encountered pertained to margin spacing and the box layout. We also had to adjust the main with the divider in the HTML file because it was in the wrong location. Chat GPT was consulted to fix minor errors like colon and semi-colon placement. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Prior to starting the assignment, I was a bit nervous, however, working with a partner was extremely helpful. We were able to assist eachother throughout the process which granted me a greater understanding of utilizng HTML and CSS code.</p>
