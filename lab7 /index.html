            <h1> Lab 7: Functions </h1>
            <p> Working with a partner, we wrote functions that take user input </p>
            <h2> Challenges </h2>
            <p> The challenge of this lab was to create an index page for lab 7. We also needed to a create a JS file and make sure everything runs smoothly.</p>
            <h3> Problems</h3>
            <p> At first, I had trouble creating the lab index and ensuring the folders werein the right position, but I was able to fix this after messing around with vs code and consulting chat gpt.</p>
            <h4> Results </h4>
            <p> As you can see, we have the index.html file we created. Here is the program.  </p>
